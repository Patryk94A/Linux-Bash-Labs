# Linux-Bash-Labs
My personal public repository - CI/CD Automatation

PROJECT IDEA

After completing my Linux and Bash Scripting courses, i came up with the idea to combine both skills into a real-world project. I'm build a Bash automation script that will automatically push all my course exercises and labs into GitHub repository from my Ubuntu OS.

This project will help me practice and reinforce everything i've learned -- and push me out of my comfort zone by sharing my work publicly.


Technologies & Tools Used
- Bash Scripting (variables, conditionals, loops, functions)
- File and Process management
- User and Permission handling
- Automation using cronjobs
- Git & GitHub fundamentals


Why am i doing this?
- To practice Bash, Linux, and Git
- to automate my workflow
- to step out of my comfort zone
